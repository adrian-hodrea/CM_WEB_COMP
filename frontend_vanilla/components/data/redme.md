This folder contains data(metadata) needed to construct the component's of the application.

For example in order to generate a form for adding a person into database... i use the Form.js from components that acts as a form constructor for creating different forms needed in the application based on the component data files that provide:
    - the title of the form
    - the fields with their labels, type of field, name of field, required or not
